    NOTES!! 
        To write down what I find out about the stuff I must fix.

==> Sending of information succeeds by means of the function 'self.send_parallel()' which works as follows: 
    
    def send_parallel(self, data, reset=True); 
        >> 'data' comprises the data which is sent. As far as I know, data is one only number. 
        
==> In AlphaBurst the info sent to the parallel port seems to be highly standarized and it's difficult to understand to me. 

==> Presentation of targets is avoided during the first half second to spare problems to the classifier. Should this be left so??
