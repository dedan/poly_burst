This is a feedback for the [pyff framework](http://github.com/venthur/pyff "Pyff Framework").

It presents random polygons and the goal is to use it in combination with an EEG Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to draw images with it.

The code is based on another Pyff Feedback programmed by *Torsten Schmits*
